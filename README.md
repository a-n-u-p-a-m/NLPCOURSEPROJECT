# NLP_COURSE_PROJECT

In this project I studied and implemented various slot filling, template filling and information extraction techniques and models. 
The first folder contains the code for the BERT model where two additional ALBERT and DistilBERT are also defined.
In the second folder is the code for RNN model which uses attention masks for the slot filling tasks.
The third folder contains the generative transformer GRIT which is used for generating the templates.
The fourth folder has the code for template filling using Named Entity Recognition.
The IPython notebook contains the results and implementation of all the codes.
